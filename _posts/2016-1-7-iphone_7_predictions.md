description: An analysis and prediction of why and how the iPhone will survive even without a headphone port.

Some may have heard by now about the rumors that the iPhone 7 will be [removing the headphone port](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/01/06/iphone-7-loses-headphone-jack/) in favor of a Lightning adapter for headphones. While I will withhold my judgement until the reviews come in, I find the decision to be particulary brilliant example of how good business and technological knowledge can enable long term design goals.

What I am going to do in this article is I am going to try to explain why Apple's decision to remove the headphone jack, while bold, is not rash or incautious, but is well-reasoned and judicious. The reason I want to explain this is because, first of all, I think it's an interesting topic, but more importantly, I don't see anyone else discussing it in this manner. Most of the discussion around this rumor is either simplistic in that it only covers the rumor from a narrow angle (e.g. corporate greed, planned vendor lock-in, blind pursuit of a thinner phone) or is simply antagonistic and dismissive of Apple, most of which is coming from the [audiophile community](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/3zqv74/iphone_7_leaks_confirm_apple_abandoning_headphone/).

Because Apple can be a hot button topic for some and I'd prefer not to be on the wrong end of a flame war, let me first explicitly state what I do **NOT** claim in this article: I do not claim Apple is either a good company or a bad company; I do not claim that Apple is better or worse than any other company; I don't even try to claim that Apple should or should not remove the headphone port on the iPhone 7.

*This* is my claim: 

**Apple's removal of the headphone jack in the iPhone 7 is a reasonable and logically sound decision that is supported by a solid and comprehensive understanding of both the current technological ecosystem and the use cases of the average consumer.** 

Now, allow me to try and prove that claim. Hopefully you will find it as interesting as I do.

###We've Been Here Before 
 The headphone port is universal on almost every single electronic device currently on the market. So it's no surprise that when it comes out that Apple's next revision of a well-established product will ship without a headphone port, people get up in arms about it with claims that it will flop or threats to switch to Android. However, people really shouldn't be this suprised by the decision either. Apple is hardly a stranger to killing off features that are ubiquitous and well established in the technology world, here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the widely supported features they've retired in the past:

* the [CD Drive and Ethernet port](http://www.macworld.com/article/1131696/macbookair_faq.html), [twice](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/cracking-open/apples-next-generation-macbook-pro-drops-ethernet-optical-drive/)
 
* the [FireWire port](http://www.gizmag.com/no-firewire-kills-the-macbook/10238/)

* [Adobe Flash](http://gizmodo.com/364173/steve-jobs-craps-on-adobe-mobile-flash-does-not-bode-well-for-iphone-support) (technically this was a refusal to support Flash on the iPhone, but it signalled the beginning of the end for Flash as an internet standard)
 
* [ALL ports but one](http://mashable.com/2015/03/09/apple-macbook-usb-c-explained/#oa68YTIZnSqX)

* the ATX form factor for workstations with the [cylindrical Mac Pro](http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/the-new-mac-pro-is-a-failure)

For Apple, removing the headphone jack would be par for the course at this point, the only difference being that this is the oldest standard that they've retired by far, with the original 6.5mm TRS connector (the standard the 3.5mm headphone port is based on) having been created in 1878. Although the circumstances surrounding the examples given don't exactly match those of the headphone port, they illustrate a trend where each one of these examples was widely derided at announcement as unwise, only to be praised after the fact as wise (admittedly, the levels of derision and praise vary pretty widely between the examples, but the trend is still there)(Reddit user Unagi33 succintly states the [Apple Fanboy version](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3zivpd/supply_chain_rumors_reaffirm_iphone_7_will_not/cympaz5) of this trend).

My predicition is that after the iPhone 7 is released, the decision to remove the headphone port will also come to be accepted as a wise decision. To understand why, let's first look at the circumstances surrounding the announcement of the first MacBook Air, the most recent Apple product to omit features that were truly universal at the time.

###The Year is 2008, Ancient Internet History
It's mid-January, 2008. [Rage comics](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rage-comics) and [Advice Animals](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/advice-animals) had not yet been created, [LOLcats](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/lolcats) and [reaction images](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/reaction-images) still reigned supreme. So basically a long time ago in internet years.

For those who are unfamiliar, or just need a refresher, Apple announced the first MacBook Air in [January of 2008](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15Apple-Introduces-MacBook-Air-The-Worlds-Thinnest-Notebook.html). At the time it was the thinnest laptop ever created, and to help achieve that goal the Air did not have a [disc drive or an ethernet port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air#Specifications). Widespread broadband access and WiFi had only just become available in homes, schools, and businesses the past few years, with WiFi hotspots in restaraunts and coffee shops [being standard fare by the end of 2008](http://www.pcworld.com/article/149620/wifi.html). The widespread penetration of WiFi and broadband internet also enabled a transition to downloadable software, movies, music, TV shows, and video games, which were previously confined to CDs and DVDs. Despite the wide penetration of WiFi and the recent availability of online content, many people (myself included) still considered the lack of features as fundamental disc drive and ethernet port to be a death sentence for the Air. Oh, how wrong we were. 

Apple's commercial success with MacBook Air can be attributed to many reasons including an incredibly loyal customer base, easily excitable media, and a well implemented hardware/software ecosystem, among other things. The role of these factors in the commerical success of the Air shouldn't be understated, however they don't illustrate why Apple knew it was okay to remove the disc drive and ethernet port before everyone else did. There are two main factors behind Apple's apparent premonition: Apple has a superior understanding of the average consumer; and Apple creates the ecosystem to support new design decisions ahead of time. 

* #### Apple Understands the Average Consumer Better
There is less hard evidence for this particular point, but I believe it to be pretty apparent. Apple and, at the time, Steve Jobs had, and still have a strong comprehension for how the average consumer uses their electronic devices. What Apple understood in 2008 was that a large portion, if not most, of average consumers were connecting to WiFi for internet intsead of using an Ethernet cable and use of the disc drive was rapidly falling as software and media content became readily available online. Apple saw that WiFi and online content delivery were gaining popularity with the average consumer and that, as a result of this trend, the disc drive and ethernet port were no longer a part of the core features required by the average consumer. With this knowledge in hand, Apple would have known that removing those features would not deprive the average user of functionality.

* #### Apple Creates the Ecosystem to Support New Design Decisions
Apple does not retire widely supported, standard features without having an ecosystem to support a device missing such features. By the time the Air was introduced, Apple had movies and TV shows [available for purchase and download on iTunes since 2005](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/10/31iTunes-Music-Store-Sells-One-Million-Videos-in-Less-Than-20-Days.html) to replace the functionality a DVD drive would have provided. As for the removal of the ethernet port, Apple had been selling the AirPort wireless router since 1999, but announced a new version called the AirPort Time Capsule at the same time the Air was announced. The Time Capsule included an internal hard drive that allowed it to be used as an external drive and backup device, making it an attractive option for the new Air which only had 80GB of storage. Apple rarely operates without a safety net however, and so in addition to ecosystem support, Apple included an ethernet adapter dongle in case WiFi wasn't available and had the SuperDrive as an optional peripheral in case users needed to use a CD or DVD.

Taking these two points, two things about the MacBook Air can be understood that weren't apparent from the other factors implicit in its success. The first revelation is that Apple was able to predict the right time to introduce the MacBook Air because it understands and closely tracks how the average user uses their computers. By tracking data on WiFi penetration and analyzing sales numbers from iTunes it would be have been relatively simple for Apple to determine that use of disc drives and wired internet was falling rapidly and permanently, it would then be a simple matter of waiting. The second revelation is that Apple makes sure that its product ecosystem is fully ready to support the removal of features in order to ensure that early adopters never miss old features. 

Taken together and applied to other decisions that Apple has made over the years, these points dispel some of the hocus pocus surrounding Apple's tendency to make the right decisions before everyone else.  

###Wireless Audio will Enable the iPhone 7
So, back to the iPhone 7. How can it survive as a product without a headphone port? The answer is, quite obviously, wireless audio. 

Can you hear that? That's the sound of thousands of audiophiles having their jimmies rustled.

Now wireless audio is most certainly not new, even ignoring the fact that the radio technically counts. Apple has had AirPlay since 2004, back when it was known as AirTunes and Bluetooth was invented in 1994 with the purpose of enabling wireless headsets. However, wireless audio didn't start to take off until recently because either you needed to be fully invested in the Apple ecosystem to make use of AirTunes/AirPlay or you were trying to use Bluetooth which, until the adoption of Bluetooth 4.0 specification, quite frankly sucked. A lot.

However, in the last few years, wireless audio has really taken off in popularity. This has mainly been enabled by the improvements introduced with the Bluetooth 4.0 specification and the introduction of single-mode bluetooth chips that enable extremely lightweight, low-power bluetooth devices, perfect for wireless headphones with small batteries. Additional factors driving wireless audio popularity are better wireless entertainment systems in cars, functionality in streaming services such as Spotify that allow remote control of other devices, and the introduction of products like Chromecast Audio.

Apple has been watching these trends and has clearly been preparing to introduce an iPhone without a headphone port for at least a year, maybe longer.

To explain why removing the headphone jack from the iPhone will work for Apple, lets dive a little deeper into the last point about creating an ecosystem. With the removal of the DVD drive, Apple prepared itself to offer video and movie playback functionality through its iTunes ecosystem, and with the removal of the initial viewing restrictions, Netflix streaming had just become a viable way to watch video content. For those that still truly needed a DVD drive Apple offered either its USB DVD drive or software functionality for using the DVD drive of an iMac over a network. The removal of the ethernet port was possible because WiFi was just beginning to become a common feature in homes, schools, and businesses, with WiFi in restaraunts and coffee shops [already becoming standard by the end of 2008](http://www.pcworld.com/article/149620/wifi.html). And in case WiFi wasn't available, Apple provided an Ethernet dongle for the Air. Apple saw the trends ahead of time and decided that they could safely introduce a device without a disc drive or an Ethernet port, because the ecosystem would either already be there to support such a device or would very soon be in place. Apple often pushes the boundaries, but they almost never do it without knowing the market can support it.

So, now that I've talked your ears off about why Air worked, what ecosystem could possibly be in place to support a phone without a headphone port? You've probably already thought of a few examples while I was beating the dead horse that was my example, but here are the things that I see:

* #### Adoption of BLE Enables Significant Improvements in Power Efficiency for Wireless Peripherals
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has enabled peripherals to communicate wirelessly using significantly less power than with Bluetooth Classic. Combined with improvements in power efficiency in microprocessors and software techniques for embedded systems, BLE has cleared the way for battery powered wireless peripherals such as wearables and, more importantly to our analysis, wireless earbuds.

* #### Growing Popularity of, and Support for, Wireless Audio
Wireless audio is gaining fast in popularity. Bluetooth speakers, both portable battery powered version like those from Ultimate Ears and wired base stations for the home have gained increasingly in popularity as of late. Google's introduction of the Chromecast Audio shows a different face of wireless audio where your phone acts as a remote to control streaming on an audio device. In addition, for some time now, Spotify has offered the capability to control audio from one device while playing it from another device.

* #### New Cars with Bluetooth Enabled Media Systems
Most, if not all, new cars come with media system that supports Bluetooth pairing with a mobile device for audio playback. Speaking of cars...

* #### Uber and Spotify's Partnership
With car ownership and, more tellingly, the [number of young adults and teenagers with drivers licenses on the fall](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15389588.2012.696755) the popularity of public transit and transportation network companies like Uber are still on the rise. In the case of Uber, they partnered with Spotify to allow riders to pick the music playing in their car if the driver has their phone connected to the car's audio system. And with driverless cars on the way, this kind of system will most likely become standard.

So here's my point, wires are on the way out for consumer devices, and the headphone cable is no exception. I don't think anyone would disagree with that point, but the headphone port is so ubiquitous that a phone without one seems wrong, like a house without a door. But the reality is, even ignoring the support for wireless audio Apple had built into its own ecosystem, there is already enough support from 3rd parties for a device without a headphone port to survive: bluetooth earbuds & speakers, an increasing number of software and devices that support wireless audio control make this possible. And just like with the MacBook Air, Apple has a peripheral for those who just need a physical headphone port with the Lightning port audio adapter. In addition, I'm willing to wager that the iPhone 7 announcement will coincide with an announcement of new Apple earbuds that are BLE capable (probably with a name like iEars or Apple Buds, priced at $150-200 (and lets be real, if Apple can successfully market a $99 stylus, Apple Buds will sell like hotcakes)).

If you read the [Forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/01/06/iphone-7-loses-headphone-jack/) that I linked at the beginning of the post all the way through, you'll notice that I've ignored the improvements to software and audio profiles that Apple adding to enable the iPhone 7, including the mention of super-high fidelity headphones that connect to the lighting port directly. I've steered away from these because I wanted to make the point that even if the iPhone 7 were to launch without those features, the 3rd party software and peripheral ecosystem needed to enable a phone with no headphone jack is already in place and relatively mature. Apple doesn't make the decision to remove a ubiquitous, widely supported feature unless they know there is sufficient infrastructure in place to enable its removal by replacing its functionality. Apple is bold, but not stupid in this regard. 

In about a month or so, the hubbub over the idea of a phone with no headphone port will reside once the information becomes common knowledge. Then, about 6 months to a year after the iPhone 7 is released most everyone will have forgotten that they thought it was a problem in the first place the decision to remove the headphone port will widely be regarded as a common sense decision, if not a wise one. And so it goes with almost all the upsets that Apple has caused in the world of consumer technology.

Discussion is one of the main reasons I decided to start this blog, so if you have comments, criticisms, corrections, or other thoughts on this piece I'd love to hear them.
