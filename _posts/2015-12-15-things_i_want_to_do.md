This is a quick list of the things that I want to accomplish with this blog in the coming year.


* #### Summarize things that I've learned from articles on either a weekly or monthly basis, with an end of the year roundup.
One of the things that I worry about is that I forget about the articles I read very soon after I finish them. To combat this I want to do something similar to what Tom Whitewell has done with his article [52 Things I Learned in 2015](https://medium.com/@tomwhitwell/52-things-i-learned-in-2015-c5c74eed24e0#.sb9l052lp). What I want to aim for is either a weekly or monthly summary of the things that I come across that have the most impact on me or from which I learn the most. I feel this exercise will encourage me to actively think about the takeaways of the things that I read so that I can get even more out of them.

* #### Write about trends and ideas that I have that are most likely half-baked and will fall apart on closer analysis.
I have a lot of thoughts and theories in my head about how things are happening and why and often I never actually try to confirm or deny these theories. I've made some progress in this by writing in a portable notebook when I'm day dreaming, so that I can keep track of my stream of consciousness, but I want to try and find evidence for the theories I ideate. To this end I will be trying to explain the things that pop into my head in a non-rambling fashion while providing either supporting or refuting evidence in order to get into the habit of thinking things through more thoroughly.

* #### Write about things that I learn on through experience, especially as an engineer only just barely into my career.
Seeing as I am so early in my career, I feel that it would be beneficial to start writing about experiences I have on the job and the lessons that I learn from those experiences. Being able to not only share those lessons with others, but also be able to go back and read my thoughts on events at the time will encourage me to actively look for lessons to take from everyday experiences.
