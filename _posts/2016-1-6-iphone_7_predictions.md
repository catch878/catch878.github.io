###"How could Apple remove something so widely used?" Well... 
Some may have heard by now about the rumors that the iPhone 7 will be [removing the headphone port](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/01/06/iphone-7-loses-headphone-jack/) in favor of a Lightning adapter for headphones. Of course, people are outraged about this, especially the audiophile community, but at this point we really shouldn't be surprised when Apple pulls something like this. Apple is hardly a stranger to killing off features that are ubiquitous and commonly regarded as necessary for a successful product, in the past they've:

* killed the [CD Drive and Ethernet port](http://www.macworld.com/article/1131696/macbookair_faq.html) more than [once](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/cracking-open/apples-next-generation-macbook-pro-drops-ethernet-optical-drive/)
 
* killed the [FireWire port](http://www.gizmag.com/no-firewire-kills-the-macbook/10238/)

* refused to support [Adobe Flash](http://gizmodo.com/364173/steve-jobs-craps-on-adobe-mobile-flash-does-not-bode-well-for-iphone-support) on the iPhone (rightfully so)
 
* killed [ALL ports but one](http://mashable.com/2015/03/09/apple-macbook-usb-c-explained/#oa68YTIZnSqX) (plus headphone jack)

* killed the standard ATX form factor by replacing it with a [trashcan inspired design](http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/the-new-mac-pro-is-a-failure) (I don't care how much better it is at cooling, it looks dumb) and subsequently killing internal expandability in favor of external expandability.

* and, of course, are most recently rumored to be killing off the universal mini TRS connector (aka 3.5mm headphone jack) in the next iPhone

For Apple, removing the headphone jack would be par for the course at this point. We could analyze any of the examples I just gave, but I'm going to dive into an analysis of the MacBook Air because I feel it is the best example to understand why Apple would remove the headphone jack and how they can do this without killing the iPhone's sales prospects. 

###No Ethernet Port? For Shame!
Back in 2008 when the MacBook Air was announced, the idea of computer without an ethernet port was pretty hard to swallow (WiFi was nowhere near as pervasive as it is now) considering how long it had been a standard component on computers. Many people (myself included) thought that the Air would be a passing fad at best, and that, while moving to thinner designs was the future, a computer lacking features that were so fundamental couldn't possibly be a success. Oh how wrong we were. 

There is a multitude of reasons that one can attribute to Apple's success with Air. Here is a short list of examples:

* #### Loyal Customers
By the time the Air was announced in January of 2008, Apple had amassed a significant group of loyal customers who were fully invested in the Apple ecosystem. People in this group will be early adopters of any new Apple product and be willing to tolerate any roadbumps and difficulties that arise from a brand new form factor.

* #### Easily Excited Media 
Apple is great at making waves, and in 2008 the Air was a breath of fresh air (ha) into a relatively stagnant PC market. Add on to this that Apple's focus on functional, minimalist design that 'just works' holds great appeal for design types like journalists, getting the media into a fervor over the Air was easy.

* #### Apple Understands the Average Consumer
Apple (and, at the time, Steve Jobs in particular) seems to have a strong comprehension of how the average consumer uses their computer. What they understand more than their competitors (especially in 2008) was that the average consumer prefers something that just works over something that can do everything. The average consumer doesn't need 4 USB ports and a mini-DP port because they rarely have that many peripherals plugged in and they almost never need to project anything. But, I think what is more fundamental than this understanding of the average consumer is that Apple realizes that niche users (video producers, designers, sysadmins, programmers) are simply average consumers with special requirements tacked on. Consumers that need functionality not built into the Air simply buy the peripherals that Apple sells (DVD drive, ethernet dongle, external display adapter) in order to give the Air the functionality they need.

* #### Apple Creates the Ecosystem to Support New Design Decisions
This is a big one in my opinion and will be my focus later. Apple doesn't kill off big, ubiquitous features without having an ecosystem to support a device missing such features. In the case of the Air, they killed off the DVD drive. For the average consumer, the DVD drive was used mostly for movies by 2008, but at that point in time the iTunes store already had popular TV shows and movies available for purchase. In addition, Netflix had just removed its restrictions on streaming and popular software programs were either already downloadable or transitioning to downloads.

**Note: the above list is in no way exhaustive and the items above don't help to understand all of the examples given above, the focus here is on why the features removed in the MacBook Air didn't doom it. Additionally, my reasoning in support of the examples above is subjective and open for debate. If you disagree, I would love to hear why in the comments.**

###But Why Male Models (Headphone Jacks)?
To explain why removing the headphone jack from the iPhone will work for Apple, lets dive a little deeper into the last point about creating an ecosystem. With the removal of the DVD drive, Apple prepared itself to offer video and movie playback functionality through its iTunes ecosystem, and with the removal of the initial viewing restrictions, Netflix streaming had just become a viable way to watch video content. For those that still truly needed a DVD drive Apple offered either its USB DVD drive or software functionality for using the DVD drive of an iMac over a network. The removal of the ethernet port was possible because WiFi was just beginning to become a common feature in homes, schools, and businesses, with WiFi in restaraunts and coffee shops [already becoming standard by the end of 2008](http://www.pcworld.com/article/149620/wifi.html). And in case WiFi wasn't available, Apple provided an Ethernet dongle for the Air. Apple saw the trends ahead of time and decided that they could safely introduce a device without a disc drive or an Ethernet port, because the ecosystem would either already be there to support such a device or would very soon be in place. Apple often pushes the boundaries, but they almost never do it without knowing the market can support it.

So, now that I've talked your ears off about why Air worked, what ecosystem could possibly be in place to support a phone without a headphone port? You've probably already thought of a few examples while I was beating the dead horse that was my example, but here are the things that I see:

* #### Adoption of BLE Enables Significant Improvements in Power Efficiency for Wireless Peripherals
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has enabled peripherals to communicate wirelessly using significantly less power than with Bluetooth Classic. Combined with improvements in power efficiency in microprocessors and software techniques for embedded systems, BLE has cleared the way for battery powered wireless peripherals such as wearables and, more importantly to our analysis, wireless earbuds.

* #### Growing Popularity of, and Support for, Wireless Audio
Wireless audio is gaining fast in popularity. Bluetooth speakers, both portable battery powered version like those from Ultimate Ears and wired base stations for the home have gained increasingly in popularity as of late. Google's introduction of the Chromecast Audio shows a different face of wireless audio where your phone acts as a remote to control streaming on an audio device. In addition, for some time now, Spotify has offered the capability to control audio from one device while playing it from another device.

* #### New Cars with Bluetooth Enabled Media Systems
Most, if not all, new cars come with media system that supports Bluetooth pairing with a mobile device for audio playback. Speaking of cars...

* #### Uber and Spotify's Partnership
With car ownership and, more tellingly, the [number of young adults and teenagers with drivers licenses on the fall](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15389588.2012.696755) the popularity of public transit and transportation network companies like Uber are still on the rise. In the case of Uber, they partnered with Spotify to allow riders to pick the music playing in their car if the driver has their phone connected to the car's audio system. And with driverless cars on the way, this kind of system will most likely become standard.

So here's my point, wires are on the way out for consumer devices, and the headphone cable is no exception. I don't think anyone would disagree with that point, but the headphone port is so ubiquitous that a phone without one seems wrong, like a house without a door. But the reality is, even ignoring the support for wireless audio Apple had built into its own ecosystem, there is already enough support from 3rd parties for a device without a headphone port to survive: bluetooth earbuds & speakers, an increasing number of software and devices that support wireless audio control make this possible. And just like with the MacBook Air, Apple has a peripheral for those who just need a physical headphone port with the Lightning port audio adapter. In addition, I'm willing to wager that the iPhone 7 announcement will coincide with an announcement of new Apple earbuds that are BLE capable (probably with a name like iEars or Apple Buds, priced at $150-200 (and lets be real, if Apple can successfully market a $99 stylus, Apple Buds will sell like hotcakes)).

If you read the [Forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/01/06/iphone-7-loses-headphone-jack/) that I linked at the beginning of the post all the way through, you'll notice that I've ignored the improvements to software and audio profiles that Apple adding to enable the iPhone 7, including the mention of super-high fidelity headphones that connect to the lighting port directly. I've steered away from these because I wanted to make the point that even if the iPhone 7 were to launch without those features, the 3rd party software and peripheral ecosystem needed to enable a phone with no headphone jack is already in place and relatively mature. Apple doesn't make the decision to remove a ubiquitous, widely supported feature unless they know there is sufficient infrastructure in place to enable its removal by replacing its functionality. Apple is bold, but not stupid in this regard. 

In about a month or so, the hubbub over the idea of a phone with no headphone port will reside once the information becomes common knowledge. Then, about 6 months to a year after the iPhone 7 is released most everyone will have forgotten that they thought it was a problem in the first place the decision to remove the headphone port will widely be regarded as a common sense decision, if not a wise one. And so it goes with almost all the upsets that Apple has caused in the world of consumer technology.

Discussion is one of the main reasons I decided to start this blog, so if you have comments, criticisms, corrections, or other thoughts on this piece I'd love to hear them.
